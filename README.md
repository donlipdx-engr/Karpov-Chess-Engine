# Karpov-Chess-Engine

## Introduction

![](https://en.chessbase.com/thumb/94097)

I am an amateur chess player who enjoys the game as a hobby. My favorite chess player of all time is Anatoly Karpov. Karpov was the World Chess Champion from 1975-85 and was known for his "boa constrictor" playing style that was both highly technical and positionally sound, but also intelligently aggressive. [Chess.com](chess.com) has bots that one can play against, including many of current and past grandmasters (GM's). However, Chess.com does not have a bot for Anatoly Karpov. Hence, this project involves me building a chess engine for a Karpov bot like the ones on Chess.com, using [this dataset of Karpov's games from 1961-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zq1200/anatoly-karpov-complete-chess-games-1961-2021/suggestions?status=pending). Here are the contents of this project:
